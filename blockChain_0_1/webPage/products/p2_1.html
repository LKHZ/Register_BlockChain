	Since 1997, the U.S. Air Force and Lockheed Martin-led A-10 Prime Team have worked closely to significantly digitize the A-10A Thunderbolt II close air support fighter to its A-10C configuration, enabling employment of new GPS and inertially-guided munitions, fingertip control of aircraft avionics and integration of Litening and Sniper Advanced Targeting Pods through a program called Precision Engagement (PE).<br>
The improvements automate many functions (navigation, weapons employment and communications) previously performed manually by the pilot, while also providing enhanced situational awareness and the ability to deliver precision-guided air-to-ground weapons.  The upcoming addition of a Helmet Mounted Cueing System (HMCS) in Suite 7 will allow for even greater efficiencies in targeting and situational awareness.<br>
The most extensive upgrade in the A-10's celebrated 35-year history, Precision Engagement combined multiple upgrades into a single contract award.<br>
Awarded to Lockheed Martin in 2001, the government-industry partnership has enabled the modifications to be completed earlier than planned and at lower cost.<br>
